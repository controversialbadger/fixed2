I need to create a task management application with spreadsheet-like functionality similar to Excel, allowing users to add, edit, and organize tasks in a table format. The app should include a calendar integration for setting task deadlines and a reminder system that alerts users via pop-up notifications at specified dates and times. The solution must be developed in Python with a modern, intuitive GUI built using a library like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy, including features such as data validation, sorting/filtering tasks, saving task lists to a file, and visually distinguishing overdue tasks.
